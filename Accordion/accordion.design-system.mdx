## General must known design system guideline :

### Color ðŸŽ¨

|  | Background | Border |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Light Theme | bg-gray-200 | border-gray-300 |
| Blue Theme | bg-blue-600 | none |
| Dark Theme | bg-slate-900 | none |
 
 

Color of `text` will depend on the `bg` color
| Background | Dark | Blue | Light |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Code in Tailwind | text-white | text-slate-900 | text-black |

`Note` : Color of the text `[color]` will depend on the color of the background

### Transition ( `transition-all` )

whenever there is a hover effect, one must use `transition-all` class with it.

### Font

For all Accordion font is : **`Default font`** but can be optimise accordingly

## Icon guidelines:

Mostly all the icons are taken from â†’ [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/)

`Icon-text-gap` :  We follow a convention of equal margin between the text and the icon as padding in y  axis `py`. and always the margin is given from the side of icon.

|  | Width | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small | w-4 & h-4 | Hero Icons mini |
| Medium | w-5 & h-5 | Hero Icons mini |
| Large | w-6 & h-6 | Hero Icons filled |

### Hover Color

For all Breadcrumbs component the hover color is **`hover:bg-blue-600`**.

### SVG And Path
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic. It can be used to make graphics and animations like in HTML canvas.  Path is always used within the svg tag to set the actual coordinate.
Wihin the tag we give the some propety as what with be the co-ordinate, fill color, outer stroke, and some styling within class attribute.

### Border Radius ðŸ”²

The normal border-radius for the components are `rounded-md`. However this does not apply in many cases like buttons, input boxes and all.

    <div class="max-h-0 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-500 peer-checked:max-h-screen">
      <p class="p-4 text-white">The main difference is that the core components from web-ui-kit are open source under
        the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that web-ui-kit relies on smaller
        and standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.</p>
      <p class="p-4 text-white">However, we actually recommend using both web-ui-kit, web-ui-kit Pro, and even Tailwind
        UI as there is no technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.</p>
